NextFM is my first website project.


The goal is to create a website that shares similar functionality with Last.fm,
but allows for more ad-hoc analytics. The unique feature of this site is the ability of users to run
their own SQL queuries against their listening data. 

This backend repository will likely ultimately be taken private.
